My dotfiles. They're here so that I can synchronize them across
computers I work with.

Install the dotfiles with `./install.sh`, which either symlinks or
copies each file to your home directory. The installation is safe: if
the target file exists in your home directory already, symlinking or
copying is not done.

I have copied or mimicked most of this stuff from someone else and
modified it to fit my use. When copying has been extensive, I have
retained the original copyright in the corresponding file. Feel free
to copy these files further, as long as you respect the original
copyrights and licensing.
