My dotfiles. So that I can synchronize them across computers I work on.

Install the dotfiles with `./install.sh`, which symlinks each file to your
home directory. The installation is safe: if the target file in your home
directory exists already, symlink is not created.

I have copied or mimicked most of this stuff from someone else and modified it
to fit my use. When copying has been extensive, I have retained the original
copyright in the corresponding file. Feel free to copy these files further, as
long as you respect the original copyrights and licensing.
